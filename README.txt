#######
Purpose
#######

An example mod to showcase infections. 
In this mod Chryssalids and Tentaculats don't kill soldiers directly but  infect them with parasites instead. 
When soldiers are finally killed by attacks or the infection, they will finally turn into zombies.

Features
########

- Chryssalids and Tentaculats infect soldiers
- Infected soldiers turn to zombies whether by the infection itself or by any other damage
- Infected soldiers are indicated with a green/orange color as visible feedback
- Medi-Kit can cure infections (previous painkiller position)
- Cure charges are dependent on research. The more research is done on Chryssalids and Tentaculats the more charges a Medi-Kit gets
- Infected surviving soldiers will be wracked by the parasite. This means that they will lose stats when finishing a mission still infected.
- Depending on research the stats lose will be reduced to 0.
- Burning infected soldiers won't turn into Zombies
- Burning Zombies will not turn into Chryssalids and Tentaculats
- This is also true if the finishing blow is done with an incendiary weapon
- Zombies have a chance to turn every turn. This chance increases with each turn.
