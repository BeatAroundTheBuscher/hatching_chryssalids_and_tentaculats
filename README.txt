Features
########

- Chryssalids and Tentaculats infect soldiers
- Infected soldiers turn to zombies whether by the infection it self or by any other damage
- Infected soldiers are indicated with a green color as visible feedback
- Medi-Kit can cure infections (previous painkiller position)
- Cure charges are dependent on research. The more research is done on Chryssalids and Tentaculats the more charges a Medi-Kit gets
- Infected surviving soldiers will be wracked by the parasite. This means that they will lose stats when finishing a mission still infected.
- Depending on research the stats lose will be reduced to 0.
